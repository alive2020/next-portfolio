# Next.js Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. 
The project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, and includes a link to my resume.

**Check out the live demo [here](https://main--ice-portfolio-next.netlify.app/).**

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alive2020/next-portfolio.git
cd next-portfolio
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
